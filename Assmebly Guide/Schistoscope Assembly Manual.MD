# Preparing the 3D Printed Parts
Some parts require additional preparation before assembly. The following parts require additional preparation:
1. Sample Stage Holder:  
Insert the M3 heat set insert into the holes (refer image) on the top of the sample stage holder. The insert should be flush with the top of the sample stage holder.
